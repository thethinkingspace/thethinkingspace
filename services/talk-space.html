        TalkSpace is a concept which aims to allow you to come and talk to a
        sympathetic and experienced psychotherapist about anything that is
        troubling you without committing to a course of treatment. This can be
        an one-off appointment whenever you need.
      </p>

      <p>
        Often you have problems you find you can’t share with your family and
        friends. You fear they might judge you or take sides or bring their own
        problems to the conversation, when all you really want is to share with
        a kind, compassionate and objective professional whatever is burdening
        you. It might be a relationship, a health or a financial worry. It might
        be loneliness or feeling lost or fear. Maybe you’re feeling sad. You
        aren’t necessarily looking for a straight answer, all you want is to
        share the pressure with a person who has no judgment to make. By opening
        up to them you might make sense of your own predicament.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their help and feedback will allow you to understand, forgive and
        improve yourself. When you feel alone your mind can play tricks and make
        a problem seem much worse. But by sharing your thoughts with a good
        listener you might start to see a solution your fear prevented you from
        seeing before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Talk takes place in a private room with an experienced psychotherapist
        to listen to and make sense of your worries. If all you want to do is
        talk that is fine. But if you want dialogue they will help you to see
        yourself and your worries in a more objective, reasoned way. Everything
        you say is strictly confidential, the only exception being if the
        listener thinks you are likely to hurt yourself or someone else.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t need anyone to refer you to TalkSpace. You just make a booking
        and turn up to our talk room. A session is in 50 minute blocks. and you
        can come as a one-off or when you need to.

      <h3>Life MOT</h3>

      <p>
        This assessment looks at your behavioural profile. What gives you
        satisfaction, what you may be avoiding through fears, and how
        consistently your lifestyle reflects what is meaningful to you. This
        assessment is based on
        <a href="/treatments/act.html">Acceptance and Commitment therapy</a>
        principals grounded in behavioural psychology. You leave with a written
        formulation of your profile and action plan to improve your overall
        wellbeing. A session lasts up to an hour and half.
