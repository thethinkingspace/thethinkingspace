      <p>The Thinking Space believes in ethical care:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Our Ethical relationship with patients entails ensuring their safety
          in treatment, providing the most appropriate treatment according to
          clients' problems, setting realistic targets and knowing when to
          complete treatments.
        </li>
        <li>
          We receive regular case supervision and attend seminars, conferences
          and regular training to ensure their continuing professional
          development.
        </li>
        <li>
          We encourage your feedback, with questionnaires before and after
          treatment. This ensures the constant improvement and development of
          care plans and our practice as a whole. A complaints procedure is
          available if any concerns arise that cannot be resolved with the
          treating practitioner.
        </li>
