      <p>
        The personal information we collect about you will mainly be used by our
        staff at TTS so that we can support you.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will not sell or share your personal information with organisations
        so that they can contact you for any marketing activities. Nor do we
        sell any information about your web browsing activity.
      </p>

      <p>
        TTS may however share your information with our trusted partners and
        suppliers who work with us on or on our behalf to deliver our services,
        but processing of this information is always carried out under our
        instruction. We make sure that they store the data securely, delete it
        when they no longer need it and never use it for any other purposes.
        Some examples of where we may share your information are with your GP,
        referring insurer, psychiatrist, or university. We enter into contracts
        with these service providers that require them to comply with Data
        Protection Laws and ensure that they have appropriate controls in place
        to secure your information.

      <h3 class="inner_heading">Legal disclosure</h3>

      <p>
        We may disclose your information if required to do so by law (for
        example, to comply with applicable laws, regulations and codes of
        practice or in response to a valid request from a competent authority);
        or, in order to enforce our conditions of sale and other agreements.
