    <p>
      CBT is a clinically and research proven breakthrough in mental health
      care. Behaviour therapy helps you weaken and break the connections between
      stress-inducing situations and your habitual reactions to them; reactions
      such as fear, depression or rage, and self-defeating or self-damaging
      behaviour.
    </p>

    <p>
      It also teaches you how to calm your mind and body, so you can feel
      better, think more clearly, and make better decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cognitive therapy teaches you how certain thinking patterns are causing
      your symptoms - by giving you a distorted picture of what's going on in
      your life, and making you feel anxious, depressed or angry for no good
      reason, or provoking you into self-destructive or sabotaging actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      When combined into CBT, behaviour therapy and cognitive therapy provide
      you with very powerful tools for stopping your symptoms and getting your
      life on a more satisfying track.
