    <p>
      FAP treatment uses the secure base of an intense and compassionate
      therapeutic relationship to foster client growth. The therapist is always
      exquisitely sensitive to clients' behaviour and compassionately shapes the
      client towards pursuing their life-values. This approach is grounded in
      precise behavioral science that focuses on in-session behaviors to create
      effective behavioral change. This interpersonal approach supercharges all
      other treatments and is recommended for clients with patterns of
      relationship issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenets of FAP are 'Awareness, Courage and therapeutic Love'. It is an
      intense curative experience which empowers the client to courageously step
      into their own life with more harmony and build deeper interpersonal
      connections.
