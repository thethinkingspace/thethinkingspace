    <p>
      This is the latest development of psychological therapy which recognizes
      that the more we fight a problem, the worse it gets. Rather than focusing
      on our symptoms, it treats the core of the issue, which is usually the
      non-acceptance of our pain. When we reject our pain and focus all our
      energy on getting rid of it, we lose sight of how we want to live well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acceptance and commitment therapy is all about what we do in life. It is
      about accepting our pain and committing to activities that are in line
      with what we value in order to live a meaningful life.

    <h3>The treatment involves:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Teaching you psychological skills to deal with your painful thoughts and
        feelings effectively – in such a way that they have much less impact and
        influence over you. (These are known as mindfulness skills.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Helping you to clarify what is truly important and meaningful to you  -
        i.e. your values - then use that knowledge to guide, inspire and
        motivate you to change your life for the better.
      </li>
    </ul>
