        access to a copy of the personal information that we hold about you,
        along with information on what personal information we use, why we use
        it, who we share it with, how long we keep it for and whether it has

        Right to object: You can object to our processing of your personal
        information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
        third party) and there is something about your particular situation
        which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. Please
        contact us as noted above, providing details of your objection.

        Portability: You can ask us to provide you or a third party with some of

      <li>
        No automated-decision making: Automated decision-making takes place when
        an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision
        without human intervention. You have the right not to be subject to
        automated decisions that will create legal effects or have a similar
        significant impact on you, unless you have given us your consent, it is
        necessary for a contract between you and us or is otherwise permitted by
        law. You also have certain rights to challenge decisions made about you.
        We do not currently carry out any automated decision-making.
      </li>
