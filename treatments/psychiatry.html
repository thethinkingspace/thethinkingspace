        A psychiatrist is a qualified medical doctor who has obtained additional
        qualifications to become a specialist in the diagnosis, treatment and
        prevention of mental illness and emotional problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of their extensive medical and psychiatric training,
        psychiatrists are able to view illness in an integrated way by taking
        into consideration the relationship between physiological and
        psychological causation of mental illness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Psychiatrists are trained both to recognise and treat the effects of
        emotional disturbances on the body as a whole, as well as the effects of
        physical conditions on the mind. This is particularly important, as many
        emotional disturbances affect various parts of the body and physical
        illnesses can certainly affect the mind. A psychiatrist's medical and
        psychiatric training allows both the physical and emotional to be kept
        in perspective.
