        Psychoanalytic psychotherapy originates from psychoanalysis and Sigmund
        Freud, but has evolved into several different schools of thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        Psychoanalytic psychotherapy mainly works with a person's unconscious
        processes and the way these affect our mental state,feelings and
        behaviour. It focuses on transference, in lay terms, the way one relates
        to one's therapist while also exploring a person's everyday life and
        relationships. It usually is a longer form of therapy where issues are
        explored in great depth and detail emphasizing how our early
        relationships shape our current life attitude and how we can work our
        way to change this. The past is revisited time and again only in the
        light of the here-and-now. Change does not only come from therapeutic
        understanding but also from relating and the revisiting of our core
        self.

        Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy is the most widely known form of therapy
        and often the most misconstrued through the film and the media. It is a
        form of therapy that can be very demanding and challenging but equally
        rewarding as it aims in internal restructuring of who we are. It
        requires commitment on the part of the patient and rigorous work. The
        therapist and patient typically meet two to three times or more a week
        but is not uncustomary for a once a week pace in some cases. The therapy
        times and days remain relatively constant during the therapeutic period.
