      <p>
        CBT is a clinically and research proven breakthrough in mental health
        care. Behaviour therapy helps you weaken and break the connections
        between stress-inducing situations and your habitual reactions to them;
        reactions such as fear, depression or rage, and self-defeating or
        self-damaging behaviour.

      <p>
        It also teaches you how to calm your mind and body, so you can feel
        better, think more clearly, and make better decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cognitive therapy teaches you how certain thinking patterns are causing
        your symptoms - by giving you a distorted picture of what's going on in
        your life, and making you feel anxious, depressed or angry for no good
        reason, or provoking you into self-destructive or sabotaging actions.
      </p>

      <p>
        When combined into CBT, behaviour therapy and cognitive therapy provide
        you with very powerful tools for stopping your symptoms and getting your
        life on a more satisfying track.
