        This is the latest development of psychological therapy which recognizes
        that the more we fight a problem, the worse it gets. Rather than
        focusing on our symptoms, it treats the core of the issue, which is
        usually the non-acceptance of our pain. When we reject our pain and
        focus all our energy on getting rid of it, we lose sight of how we want
        to live well.
      </p>

        Acceptance and commitment therapy is all about what we do in life. It is
        about accepting our pain and committing to activities that are in line
        with what we value in order to live a meaningful life.
      </p>

      <h3>The treatment involves:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Teaching you psychological skills to deal with your painful thoughts
          and feelings effectively – in such a way that they have much less
          impact and influence over you. (These are known as mindfulness
          skills.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Helping you to clarify what is truly important and meaningful to you 
          - i.e. your values - then use that knowledge to guide, inspire and
          motivate you to change your life for the better.
        </li>
      </ul>
