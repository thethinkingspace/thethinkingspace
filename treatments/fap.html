        FAP treatment uses the secure base of an intense and compassionate
        therapeutic relationship to foster client growth. The therapist is
        always exquisitely sensitive to clients' behaviour and compassionately
        shapes the client towards pursuing their life-values. This approach is
        grounded in precise behavioral science that focuses on in-session
        behaviors to create effective behavioral change. This interpersonal
        approach supercharges all other treatments and is recommended for
        clients with patterns of relationship issues.

        The tenets of FAP are 'Awareness, Courage and therapeutic Love'. It is
        an intense curative experience which empowers the client to courageously
        step into their own life with more harmony and build deeper
        interpersonal connections.
