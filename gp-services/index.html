          We always provide our referrers with an assessment report with
          treatment recommendations and keep the medical practitioner informed
          of progress and end of therapy.

        If the patient is on psychotropic medication, we liaise closely with the
        medical practitioner concerning any changes. Our aim is to increase our
        patients’ psychological resilience in order to work towards reducing
        their need for anti-depressants or anti-anxiolytics.
