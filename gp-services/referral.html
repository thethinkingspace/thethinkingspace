      <h3>GP and Consultant referral (NHS and private)</h3>

      <p>
        We welcome referrals from GPs and consultants, as prompt psychological
        treatment improves recovery and may reduce the need for medication, and
        patients who can invest in private therapy and who want to be seen
        quickly are removed from the NHS waiting list.
      </p>
      <h3>Company referrals</h3>

      <p>
        Content and motivated staff means increased creativity and productivity,
        and reduced stress-related work absences. Constant stress leads to a
        decrease in immune system functions, therefore more illness and
        depressed cognitive functioning.
