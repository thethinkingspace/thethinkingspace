        As a practice, we often keep abreast of the latest developments in CBT
        and third wave developments such as Acceptance and Commitment therapy,
        promoting the most effective psychological interventions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are happy to share our knowledge by providing CPD sessions for GP
        practices, free of charge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Topics can include: Quick interventions for depression and anxiety or
        Quick interventions to increase patientsâ€™ quality of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        These topics can help GP to provide psycho-education to patients within
        their consultation time.
